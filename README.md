A Prescriptive Model for Strategic Decision-making, An Inventory Management Decision Model

Introduction

Inventories are a significant investment for organizations, making proper management crucial. Excessive inventory indicates poor financial and operational control, while insufficient inventory can lead to business failure. Managers face two key inventory decisions: determining how much to order or produce in each interval and when to do so to minimize total inventory costs. These costs include holding costs, such as capital tied up, storage expenses, and potential losses, plus ordering costs, which involve expenses related to replenishing inventory. For this manufacturing company, inventory decisions for a key engine component are uncertain. The annual demand is 15,000 units with a constant cost of $80 per unit. Holding costs are estimated at 18% of the unit value, and each order costs $220. The company follows a reorder policy based on predetermined levels that “provide sufficient stock to meet demand until the supplier’s order can be shipped and received; and then to order twice as many units.” Effective inventory management is crucial to balance costs and ensure optimal stock levels for smooth operations. This analysis explores the tradeoff in inventory management, aiming to minimize the total cost by running a prescriptive model in determining the timing of orders and the order quantity. It considers various scenarios and examines the impact of different model parameters on cost-reduction strategies.
